 I want you to create a three page SPA using React.  
On each page, I want you to fetch some data from a third party API and render it to the page. 
At least one of the pages has to have a form where it collects some user data that will be queried against the API /to return data. EX: I would put in my zip code and the API would fetch the weather for that zip. 
In Github, create a new repo and add me and Dan as collaborators so we can view your code!
 
 Acceptance criteria:
                 1)  You must create a repo in Github and add me and Dan as collaborators.
                 2)  The app must be three pages that the user can click back and forth between using a header with the links laid out.
                 3)  Each of those pages much make 1 XHR request to a free API of your choosing (https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)
                 4)  At least one of those pages should request user data from a form to the API to make that request.
               5)  Use Create React App to scaffold the application. (https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
